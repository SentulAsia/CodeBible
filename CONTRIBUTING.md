## Pull requests

**Contributions are welcome**! That said, please *be prepared to edit* your pull request at request, and provide a jsFiddle of your fork working interoperably with every "mode" that Code Bible supports, and with varying numbers of slides, slidesToShow & slidesToScroll. Failure to do so will result in your pull request being closed.

*Please note that while Code Bible is open source, this is still my baby, and by submitting a pull request you are authorizing me to edit or modify it in any way shape or form. You will be listed in Github as a contributor, but I have and will continue to steer the direction of this project.*
